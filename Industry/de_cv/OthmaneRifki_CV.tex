\section{Summary}

% Data science
Data scientist and physicist with {\bf 8 years experience} at {\bf CERN} in solving complex problems with {\bf scientific rigor}.
Performed advanced statistical analysis of {\bf datasets of hundreds of petabytes} collected from 100 million sensors and processed with worldwide {\bf distributed cloud computing}. Applied {\bf optimization} and {\bf machine learning} techniques to high-dimensional datasets. Maintained {\bf monitoring tools} of data quality using {\bf anomaly detection} and {\bf time series} analysis.

{\begin{itemize}\setlength\itemindent{-2.2em}
\item Helped refute one of the most promising hypotheses on the nature of dark matter (85\% of the mass of the universe), by analyzing 10 million billion proton collisions of {\bf complex and high dimensional data}
\item Narrowed the search for new particles of supersymmetry by 50\% via likelihood-based statistical analyses on petabyte-scale dataset using {\bf predictive modeling algorithms}
\item Built {\bf economical} micron-level precision pick-and-place assembly unit using computer vision algorithms to build the next-generation multi-million dollar particle detector; see here a \href{https://youtu.be/rU1wHZcM4Ng}{\bluelink{video}} of the machine at work
\item Oversaw the project {\bf expenditure budget} of \$$300$k while coordinating a team of scientists, engineers, and suppliers
\item Supervised a team of 10 scientists and rotated on-call responsibility to achieve a data recording efficiency of 95\%
