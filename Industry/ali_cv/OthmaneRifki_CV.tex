\section{Summary}

% Data science
Data scientist and physicist with {\bf 8 years experience} in advanced statistical analysis of {\bf petabyte-scale datasets} of proton collisions recorded at {\bf CERN} and processed with worldwide {\bf distributed cloud computing systems}. Deployed {\bf online filtering} algorithms for on-the-fly selection of collision data. Maintained {\bf monitoring and validation tools} for detector performance and data quality using {\bf anomaly detection} algorithms and {\bf time series} analysis.
%Developed the main data analysis software framework (for 50+ people) relying upon {\bf version control} and {\bf issue tracking} tools.

Led several {\bf cross-functional} teams with regular deadlines and quarterly publications searching for rare signal processes among large backgrounds, employing numerous optimization and regression modeling algorithms, leveraging {\bf machine learning} techniques such
as {\bf deep learning}, {\bf clustering} and {\bf decision trees}.
