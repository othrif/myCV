\section{Summary}

% Data science
Data scientist and physicist with {\bf 8 years experience} in advanced statistical analyses of large datasets ($\sim50$ PB) of proton collisions recorded at CERN and processed with world-wide distributed computing systems (grid and cloud).

Led several {\bf cross-functional} analysis teams with weekly deadlines and quarterly scientific publications searching for rare signal processes of new physics among large backgrounds (rate $\sim10^{-9}$), employing numerous optimization and regression modeling techniques, leveraging {\bf machine learning} algorithms and {\bf deep learning} frameworks.

Developed the main data analysis software framework (for 50+ people) relying upon {\bf version control} and
{\bf issue tracking} tools. Deployed {\bf online filtering} algorithms for on-the-fly selection of proton collision data.
 %to match storage capacity requirements
 Maintained monitoring and validation tools for detector performance and data quality using {\bf anomaly detection} algorithms and {\bf time series} analysis.
